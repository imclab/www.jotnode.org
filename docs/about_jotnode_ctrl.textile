Those notes about *jotnode-ctrl*. This tool is the basic command line controller for jotnode. This page is currently more a specification than a documentation as the tool is not yet written. It will be part of the node-neoip repository.

h1. TODO

* this is the OneStop command for the user
** the rest may be in nodejs directly or in bash, or just warpper on top of neoip-jotnode.cpp
** but this command is the one stop

h1. available commands

* jotnode-ctrl identity
** provides info on the identity + acl
** direct to neoip-router --info
* jotnode-ctrl export_selfsigned DST_FILE
** to export the local identity
** valid IIF selfsigned
*** authsigned are global so no need to export it
* jotnode-ctrl import_selfsigned SRC_FILE
** the import part of the @jotnode-ctrl export_selfsigned@ command
* jotnode-ctrl register DNSNAME
** how to handle all the auth case ? selfsigned/authsigned/nonesigned
** do you provide something easier on top ? unclear
* jotnode-ctrl create_ca
** to create a certificate authority
* jotnode-ctrl sign_ca
** to sign a request generated by *register* command when using a authsigned identity
** hmmm im not sure how to handle the registering part
* jotnode-ctrl start
** same as sudo /etc/init.d/neoip-router start
** do it for all init.d command
